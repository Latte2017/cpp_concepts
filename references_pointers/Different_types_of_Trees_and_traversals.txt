Complete Tree:
	A complete tree has all 2 branches on all nodes except for the leaf node. 
	A level order tree is unsed to serialize or deserialize
				2
		3			4
	1		5	6		7

Full Tree:
	A full tree can have 0 or 2 children. Can be stored using pre order or post order with -1

Binary Search Tree:
	A Binary search tree has values where 
	1) Left is always less than root which is always less than right. 
	2) left value range in -infanity to value of root
	3) right value is root to +infanity
	4) Tree can be stored using pre order or post order

Biary Tree:
	1) Binary tree is a tree that doesnt have the restriction of BST 
		which can be a complete tree or full tree
	2) Can be stored using pre order or post order with -1 if a node doesnt exist
	3) Stored using pre order with -1 for non exististing nodes


Traversal:
	Tree:
					10
			5				12
		1		6		11		13



	In order:
		left, root and right
		1 5 6 10 11 12 13

	Pre order:
		root, left and right
		10 5 1 6 12 11 13

	Post order:
		left, right and root
		1 6 5 11 13 12 10

	Level order:
		level of tree. Root, left, right
		10, 5, 12, 1, 6, 11, 13
